\opening{Dear participant,}
Thanks for registering to our short course on ``Model fitting and
inference for infectious disease dynamics'', 14--17 June at the London
School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). A few notes ahead of
the course:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Remember that you are expected to bring your own laptop with R
<<<<<<< HEAD
installed. Please make sure you have a recent version of R installed ($\gt$3.2.0),
ideally the most recent one (3.3.0). If any of that is a problem, let us know
and we will come up with a solution. We will also have some replacement laptops
available, in case something breaks during the course.

installed. Please make sure you have a recent version of R installed,
ideally the most recent one (3.2.0), and that you can install new packages. If
any of that is a problem, let us know and we will come up with a solution. We
will also have some replacement laptops available, in case something breaks
during the course. 
>>>>>>> origin/master
\item An internet connection will be required for the course. The easiest
way for most of you is probably to connect through \emph{eduroam} --- if you
don't have this set up on your laptop it might be worth checking how you
can get access. If you are not based at an academic institution or can't
get access to eduroam for another reason, we will set you up to connect
through LSHTM's own wireless network.
\item Attached is an introduction to some R commands and concepts
we will use during the course. If you don't use R in your daily work, it
would be useful to work through this ahead of the course. If you are a
regular R user, perhaps have a quick read to 
make sure we will be on the same page.
\item We will use the R package \texttt{pomp} in one of the
  sessions. To save time, it would be great if you could try and
  install it using the instructions provided at the 
  \href{http://pomp.r-forge.r-project.org/vignettes/getting_started.html#installing-the-package}{package web site},
  paying particular attention to the ``Important information for
  Windows and Mac users.'' Again, let us know if you encounter any
  problems with this.
\item Also attached is a rough timetable. We will start at 10am on Tuesday 14th,
and close at 3pm on Friday 17th. Lunches are not included in the
course fee. There are plenty of very reasonably priced lunch options in
and around the London School --- we will give you more information on
this during the course.
\item We have booked a nearby restaurant serving simple English cuisine for

Wednesday, 18th June, 7pm. We are hoping that as many as possible of you

can join --- if you already know that you won't be able to come to this,
please let us know to facilitate planning. The price of the dinner will
be covered by the course fee. There will be vegetarian options --- if you
have any other dietary requirements, please let us know as soon as
possible.
\item We are hoping for in interesting and stimulating course. If there are
any burning issues on your mind that you would like discussed, please
let us know and we'll try our best to accommodate your wishes. Note
that on Thursday we'll have an open session to discuss any
questions on model fitting and inference you
have come across in your own work.  

\end{enumerate}
Any further questions, please do not hesitate to email us at \href{mailto:mfiidd.lshtm@gmail.com}{mfiidd.lshtm@gmail.com}.

\closing{See you soon in London,}

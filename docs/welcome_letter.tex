\opening{Dear participant,}
Thanks for registering to our short course on ``Model fitting and
inference for infectious disease dynamics'', 8--10 July at the London
School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). A few notes ahead of
the course:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Remember that you are expected to bring your own laptop with R
installed. If that is a problem, let us know and we will be able to
provide a solution. We will also have some replacement laptops
available, in case something breaks during the course.
\item An internet connection will be required for the course. The easiest
way for most of you is probably to connect through \emph{eduroam} --- if you
haven't got this set up on your laptop it might be worth checking how you
can get access. If you are not based at an academic institution or can't
get access to eduroam for another reason, we will set you up to connect
through LSHTM's own wireless network.
\item You will find attached an introduction to the R commands and concepts
we will use during the course. If you don't use R in your daily work, it
would be useful for you to work through this ahead of the course. Even
if you are a regular R user, it might be worth having a quick read to
make sure we will be on the same page. Please note also that you should
update your R installation to the latest version, to make sure we won't
run into trouble because of incompatible or changed packages. Further
instructions are in the attached document.
\item Also attached is a timetable. We will start at 10am on Tuesday 8th,
and close at 3pm on Thursday 10th. Lunches are not included in the
course fee. There are plenty of very reasonbly priced lunch options in
and around the London School --- we will give you more information on
this during the course.
\item We have booked a nearby restaurant serving simple English cuisine for
Wednesday, 9th July, 7pm. We are hoping that as many as possible of you
can join --- if you already know that you won't be able to come to this,
please let us know to facilitate planning. The price of the dinner will
be covered by the course fee. There will be vegetarian options --- if you
have any other dietary requirements, please let us know as soon as
possible.
\item Note that the Tour de France is passing through London on 7th
July. If you want to spend an extra day in London, it will probably be
very busy, but also a unique opportunity to see some top cycling going
right through the heart of the city (if you can make it through the
crowds).
\item We are hoping for in interesting and stimulating course. If there are
any burning issues on your mind that you would like discussed, please
let us know and we'll try our best to accommodate your wishes.
\item Any further questions, please do not hesitate to email us at

\end{enumerate}

\closing{See you soon in London,}
\end{letter}

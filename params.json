Please install the last version: R-3.1.0.\r\n* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (optional) is a popular graphic user interface (GUI).\r\n* [Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer) is a program for analysing the trace files generated by Bayesian MCMC runs.\r\n\r\n## Installation of the fitcourseR package\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to install the `fitcourseR` is to use the `devtools` package:\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"sbfnk/mfiidd/fitcourseR\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can check that everything went fine by loading the package into your `R` session:\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(fitcourseR)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n1. [Overview of fitcourseR](fitcourseR.md)\r\n2. [My first fitmodel](first_fitmodel.md)\r\n3. [Data and likelihood](data_likelihood.md)\r\n4.

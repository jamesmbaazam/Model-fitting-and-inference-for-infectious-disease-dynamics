# Required software
* [R](http://cran.r-project.org) is used as the main programming language. Please install at least version: R-3.2.0.
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (optional) is a popular graphic user interface (GUI).

If you are not familiar with `R`, check our [list of useful commands](slides/rintro.pdf).

# Installation of the fitR package

The simplest way to install the `fitR` is to use the `devtools` package:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("sbfnk/fitR")
```

Then you can check that the installation completed successfully by loading the package into your `R` session:

```{r load, eval=FALSE}
library(fitR)
```

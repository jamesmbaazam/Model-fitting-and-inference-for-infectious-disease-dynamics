# Model fitting and inference for infectious disease dynamics

This repository contains all the material to create the mfiidd webpage with the practicals.

All the raw material is in the folder `/Rmd` and is written in `Rmarkdown`.

The `html` pages are generated using the function `compile_mfiidd` in `R/compile_mfiidd.R`. See the top of that file for an explanation of the available options.

The `html` pages are created in `/website`, which needs to be transferred (including sub-directories) to the `gh-pages` branch for publication.

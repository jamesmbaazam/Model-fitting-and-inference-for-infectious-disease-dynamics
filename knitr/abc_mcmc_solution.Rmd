This is how you can run ABC-MCMC

```{r abc_mcmc, eval = F}
abc.trace <- mcmcMH(target = my_ABCLogPosterior_tdc,
                    init.theta = theta,
                    n.iterations = 1000,
                    limits = list(lower = c(R0 = 1, D.lat = 0, D.inf = 0, D.imm = 0, alpha = 0, rho = 0),
                                  upper = c(R0 = Inf, D.lat = Inf, D.inf = Inf, D.imm = Inf, alpha = 1, rho = 1)))
```

You can copy and paste the function into your **R** session, and proceed from there.

[Return](ABC.md#distance-between-observed-and-simulated-summary-statistics) to the ABC session.

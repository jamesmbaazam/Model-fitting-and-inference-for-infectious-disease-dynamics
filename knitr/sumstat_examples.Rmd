Here is a (by no means exhaustive) list of examples for summary statistics.

```{r echo=FALSE}
read_chunk('sumstat_examples.r')
```

```{r sumstat_examples}
```

Copy and paste any of these you would like to test, and rename (or assign) to `my_summaryStat1`, `my_SummaryStat2`, etc. (or replace these with the function names given here later when calling the distance function etc).

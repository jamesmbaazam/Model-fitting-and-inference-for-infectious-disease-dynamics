Here is a (by no means exhaustive) list of examples for summary statistics.

```{r echo=FALSE}
read_chunk('distance_examples.r')
```

```{r distance_examples}
```

Copy and paste any of these you would like to test, and rename (or assign) to `my_distance` (or replace this with one of the function names given here later when calling `computeDistanceABC` etc.)

[Return](ABC.md#distance-between-observed-and-simulated-summary-statistics) to the ABC session.

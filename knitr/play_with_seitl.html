<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The aim of this session is to familiarise yourselves with the SEITL model. This model has been proposed as a mechanistic explanation for a two-wave influenza A/H3N2 epidemic that occurred on the remote island of Tristan da Cunha in 1971. Given the small population size of this island (284 habs), demographic stochasticity is expected to play a significant role in the dynamics of the epidemic so that the use of a stochastic model is recommended. However, as you will see in the next lecture, fitting a stochastic model is computationally much more intensive than fitting a deterministic model. We will therefore close this session by fitting the deterministic SEITL model. Actually, this will be useful to prepare the next session, when you will fit the stochastic model.</p>
<p>In this session you will</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

</ol>
<p>But first of all, let's have a look at the data.</p>
<h1 id="tristan-da-cunha-outbreak">Tristan da Cunha outbreak</h1>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/SEITL_model/TdC.png" />
</div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha">Tristan da Cunha</a> is a volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It has been inhabited since the <span class="math">\(19^{th}\)</span> century and in 1971, the 284 islanders were living in the single village of the island: Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. Whereas the internal contacts were typical of close-knit village communities, contacts with the outside world were infrequent and mostly due to fishing vessels that occasionally took passengers to or from the island. These ships were often the cause of introduction of new diseases into the population (Samuels1963). Focusing on influenza, no epidemic has been reported since an epidemic of A/H1N1 in 1954. In this context of a small population with limited immunity against influenza, an unusual epidemic occurred in 1971, 3 years after the global emergence of the new subtype A/H3N2.</p>
<p>On August 13, a ship returning from Cape Town landed five islanders on Tristan da Cunha. Three of them developed acute respiratory disease during the 8-day voyage and the other two presented similar symptoms immediately after landing. Various family gatherings welcomed their disembarkation and in the ensuing days, an epidemic started to spread rapidly throughout the whole island population. After three weeks of propagation, while the epidemic was declining, some islanders developed second attacks and a second peak of cases was recorded. The epidemic faded out after this second wave and lasted a total of 59 days.</p>
<p>Among the 284 islanders, 273 (96%) experienced at least one attack and 92 (32%) experienced two attacks. Unfortunately, only 312 of the 365 attacks (85%) are known to within a single day of accuracy and constitute the dataset reported by Mantle &amp; Tyrrell in 1973 (ref:Mantle1973}.</p>
<p>The dataset of daily incidence can be loaded and plotted as follows:</p>

<h1 id="seitl-model">SEITL model</h1>
<p>One possible explanation for the rapid reinfections reported during this two-wave outbreak is that following recovery from a first infection, some islanders did not develop a long-term protective immunity and remained fully susceptible to reinfection by the same influenza strain that was still circulating. This can be modelled as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/SEITL_model/SEITL.png" alt="The SEITL model extends the classical SEIR model to account for the dynamics and host heterogeneity of the immune response among the islanders. Following recovery, hosts remain temporarily protected against reinfection thanks to the cellular response. Accordingly, they enter the T stage (temporary protection). Then, following down-regulation of the cellular response, the humoral response has a probability \alpha to reach a level sufficient to protect against reinfection. In this case, recovered hosts enter the L stage (long-term protection) but otherwise they remain unprotected and re-enter the susceptible pool (S)." /><p class="caption">The SEITL model extends the classical SEIR model to account for the dynamics and host heterogeneity of the immune response among the islanders. Following recovery, hosts remain temporarily protected against reinfection thanks to the cellular response. Accordingly, they enter the T stage (temporary protection). Then, following down-regulation of the cellular response, the humoral response has a probability <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> to reach a level sufficient to protect against reinfection. In this case, recovered hosts enter the L stage (long-term protection) but otherwise they remain unprotected and re-enter the susceptible pool (S).</p>
</div>
<p>The SEITL model can be described with five states (S, E, I, T and L) and five parameters:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>basic reproductive number (<span class="math">\(R_0\)</span>)</li>
<li>latent period (<span class="math">\(D_\mathrm{lat}\)</span>)</li>
<li>infectious period (<span class="math">\(D_\mathrm{inf}\)</span>)</li>
<li>temporary-immune period (<span class="math">\(D_\mathrm{imm}\)</span>)</li>
<li>probability of developing a long-term protection (<span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>and the following deterministic equations:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= - \beta S \frac{I}{N} + (1-\alpha) \tau T\\
\frac{dE}{dt} &amp;= \beta S \frac{I}{N} - \epsilon E\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \epsilon E - \nu I\\
\frac{dT}{dt} &amp;= \nu I - \tau T\\
\frac{dL}{dt} &amp;= \alpha \tau T\\
\end{aligned}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\beta=R_0/D_\mathrm{inf}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\epsilon=1/D_\mathrm{lat}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\nu = 1/D_\mathrm{inf}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\tau=1/D_\mathrm{imm}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N = S + I + R\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p>However, in order to account for the type of data reported during the outbreak we need to add one state variable and one parameter to the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dataset represents daily incidence counts: we need to create a <span class="math">\(6^\mathrm{th}\)</span> state variable - called <span class="math">\(\mathrm{Inc}\)</span> - to track the number of daily new cases. Assuming that new cases are reported when they become symptomatic and infectious, we have the following equation for the new state variable: <span class="math">\[
\frac{d\mathrm{Inc}}{dt} = \epsilon E
\]</span></li>
<li>The dataset is incomplete: only 85% of the cases were reported. In addition, we need to account for potential under-reporting of asymptomatic cases. We assume that the data were reported according to a Poisson process with reporting rate <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span>. Since this reporting rate is unknown (we can only presume that it should be below 85%) we will include it as an additional parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deterministic SEITL model is already implemented as a <code>fitmodel</code> object, which can be loaded into your <strong>R</strong> session by typing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">example</span>(SEITL_deterministic)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Take 5 min</strong> to look at the different elements of the model. In particular, you might be interested in how the daily incidence is computed in the function <code>SEITL_deter$simulate</code> and how the likelihood function <code>SEITL_deter$pointLogLike</code> accounts for under-reporting.</p>
<h1 id="deterministic-vs-stochastic-simulations">Deterministic vs Stochastic simulations</h1>
<h2 id="deterministic-simulations">Deterministic simulations</h2>
<p>Now, let's assess whether the deterministic SEITL model can reproduce the two-wave outbreak of Tristan da Cunha. You can start simulating the model using guess values for the initial state and the parameters. To give you some hints, here is a summary of information on influenza found in the literature:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <span class="math">\(R_0\)</span> of influenza is commonly estimated around 2. However, it can be significantly larger (<span class="math">\(R_0&gt;10\)</span>) in close knit communities due to their exceptional contact rates.</li>
<li>Both the average latent and infectious periods for influenza have been estimated around 2 days each.</li>
<li>The down-regulation of the cellular response is completed 15 days after symptom onset on average.</li>
<li>Serological surveys have shown that the seroconversion rate to influenza (probability to develop specific antibodies) is around 80%. However, it is likely that <strong>not</strong> all seroconvereted individuals acquire a long-term protective humoral immunity.</li>
<li>Between 20 and 30% of the infection with influenza are asymptomatic.</li>
<li>There is very limited cross-immunity between influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these informations and the description of the outbreak, propose one or more set(s) of values for the parameters (<code>theta</code>) and initial state (<code>init.state</code>) of the model? You can also use our 3 sets of values that can be loaded by typing <code>example(SEITL_guess_values)</code>.</p>
<p>In the previous practical you have simulated trajectories using <code>genObsTraj</code> and then plot them with <code>plotTraj</code>. Actually, the function <code>plotFit</code> combine these two steps by simulating and displaying model trajectories against the data:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">theta.bad.guess &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dt">R0 =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">D.lat =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">D.inf =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">alpha =</span> <span class="fl">0.9</span>, <span class="dt">D.imm =</span> <span class="dv">13</span>, 
    <span class="dt">rho =</span> <span class="fl">0.85</span>)
init.state.bad.guess &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dt">S =</span> <span class="dv">250</span>, <span class="dt">E =</span> <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dt">I =</span> <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dt">T =</span> <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dt">L =</span> <span class="dv">30</span>, <span class="dt">Inc =</span> <span class="dv">0</span>)
<span class="kw">plotFit</span>(SEITL_deter, theta.bad.guess, init.state.bad.guess, <span class="dt">data =</span> FluTdC1971)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/SEITL_model/oneTraj.png" title="" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You can also display all states variables (not only the observation) by passing <code>all.vars=TRUE</code></p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">plotFit</span>(SEITL_deter, theta.bad.guess, init.state.bad.guess, <span class="dt">data =</span> FluTdC1971, 
    <span class="dt">all.vars =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/SEITL_model/allVars.png" title="" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Although the simulation of the trajectory is deterministic, the observation process is stochastic, hence the noisy <code>obs</code> time-series. You can appreciate the variability of the observation process by plotting several replicates (use the argument <code>n.replicates</code>):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">plotFit</span>(SEITL_deter, theta.bad.guess, init.state.bad.guess, <span class="dt">data =</span> FluTdC1971, 
    <span class="dt">n.replicates =</span> <span class="dv">100</span>)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/SEITL_model/manyObs.png" title="" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>By default, this function plots the mean, median as well as the <span class="math">\(95^\mathrm{th}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(50^\mathrm{th}\)</span> percentiles of the replicated simulations. Alternatively, you can visualize all the simulated trajectories by passing <code>summary=FALSE</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">plotFit</span>(SEITL_deter, theta.bad.guess, init.state.bad.guess, <span class="dt">data =</span> FluTdC1971, 
    <span class="dt">n.replicates =</span> <span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dt">summary =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/SEITL_model/allTraj.png" title="" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now, <strong>take 10 min</strong> to get yourself familiar with the function <code>plotFit</code> and explore the dynamics of your model for different parameter and initial state values. In particular, try different values for <span class="math">\(R_0\in[2-15]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\alpha\in[0.3-1]\)</span>. For which values of <span class="math">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> do you get a descent fit?</p>
<p>If you didn't get a descent fit, try <code>theta.guess3</code> and <code>init.state.guess3</code> that you can load by typing <code>example(SEITL_guess_values)</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have a descent fit, you should note the low prevalence between the two waves. This suggests that the continuous approximation made by the deterministic model might not be appropriate and that we should use a stochastic model. In contrast to deterministic models, stochastic models explicitly take into account the discrete nature of individuals.</p>
<h2 id="stochastic-simulations">Stochastic simulations</h2>
<p>The stochastic SEITL model is already implemented as a <code>fitmodel</code> object, which can be loaded into your <strong>R</strong> session by typing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">example</span>(SEITL_stochastic)</code></pre>
<p>As you can read from the loading messages, <code>SEITL_sto</code> mainly differs from <code>SEITL_deter</code> through the <code>simulate</code> function, which replaces the deterministic equations solver by a stochastic simulation algorithm. More precisely, this algorithm takes a list of transitions (<code>SEITL_transitions</code>) and a function to compute the transition rate (<code>SEITL_rateFunc</code>). <strong>Take 5 min</strong> to have a look at the function <code>SEITL_sto$simulate</code> and make sure you understand all the transitions and rates.</p>
<p>If you are curious about how the stochastic model is simulated, you can have a look at the code of the function <code>simulateModelStochastic</code>. You will note that it calls the function <code>ssa.adaptivetau</code> of the <strong>R</strong> package <code>adaptivetau</code>, and then process the returned data frame in order to extract the state of the model at the desired observation times given by <code>times</code>.</p>
<p>Then <strong>take 10 min</strong> to explore the dynamics of the stochastic SEITL model with the function <code>plotFit</code>. Note that <code>SEITL_sto</code> has the same <code>theta.names</code> and <code>state.names</code> as <code>SEITL_deter</code>, which means that you can use the same parameters and initial state vectors as in the previous section. In addition, you can plot the time-series of the proportion of faded out simulations by passing <code>p.extinction=TRUE</code> to <code>plotFit</code>.</p>
<p>What differences do you notice between stochastic and deterministic simulations? Conclude on the role of demographic stochasticity on the dynamics of the SEITL model.</p>
<h1 id="exponential-vs-erlang-distributions">Exponential vs Erlang distributions</h1>
<p>So far, we have assumed that the time spent in each compartment was following an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a>. This distribution has the well known property of being memoryless, which means that the probability of leaving a compartment doesn't depend on the time already spent in this compartment. Although mathematically convenient, this property is not realistic for many biological processes such as the contraction of the cellular response. In order to include a memory effect, it is common to replace the exponential distribution by an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution">Erlang distribution</a>. This distribution is parametrised by its mean <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and shape <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and can be modelled by <span class="math">\(k\)</span> consecutive sub-stages, each being exponentially distributed with mean <span class="math">\(m/k\)</span>. As illustrated below the flexibility of the Erlang distribution ranges from the exponential (<span class="math">\(k=1\)</span>) to Gaussian-like (<span class="math">\(k&gt;&gt;1\)</span>) distributions.</p>
<p><img src="figure/SEITL_model/erlang.png" title="" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can extend the SEITL as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure/SEITL_model/SEIT2L.png" alt="The SEIT2L model extends the SEITL model to account for memory effect in the contraction of the cellular response. The time spend in the T compartment (temporary protection) follow an Erlang distribution with mean D_\mathrm{imm}=1/\tau and shape equal to 2." /><p class="caption">The SEIT2L model extends the SEITL model to account for memory effect in the contraction of the cellular response. The time spend in the <span class="math">\(T\)</span> compartment (temporary protection) follow an Erlang distribution with mean <span class="math">\(D_\mathrm{imm}=1/\tau\)</span> and shape equal to 2.</p>
</div>
<p>The deterministic and stochastic SEIT2L models are already implemented as <code>fitmodel</code> objects, which can be loaded into your <strong>R</strong> session by typing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">example</span>(SEIT2L_deterministic)
<span class="kw">example</span>(SEIT2L_stochastic)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Take 5 min</strong> to have a look at the function <code>simulate</code> of these SEIT2L models and make sure you understand how the Erlang distribution for the <span class="math">\(T\)</span> compartment is coded.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>take 10 min</strong> to compare the dynamics of the SEITL and SEIT2L model using <code>plotFit</code>. Use your best guess from the previous exercise as well as stochastic and deterministic simulations. Note that although SEITL and SEIT2L share the same parameters, their state variables differ so you need to modify the <code>init.state</code> of SEIT2L accordingly.</p>
<p>Can you notice any differences? If so, which model seems to provide the best fit? Do you understand why the shape of the epidemic changes as you change the distribution of the <span class="math">\(T\)</span> compartment?</p>
<h1 id="fitting-the-deterministic-models">Fitting the deterministic models</h1>
<p>As you will see in the next session, fitting a stochastic model is computationally much more intensive than fitting a deterministic model. This can lead to a waste of time and computational resources:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you initialise the MCMC with a <code>init.theta</code> far from the region of high posterior density, the chain might take a long time to reach this region and you will have to burn a lot of iterations.</li>
<li>If the covariance matrix of the Gaussian proposal is very different from the posterior, this will result in poor mixing and sub-optimal acceptance rate and you will have to thin a lot your chain.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this context, it might be useful to run a MCMC on the deterministic model first, which is fast, and then learn from the output of this chain to initialise the chain for the fit of the stochastic model. The rational for this approach is that the deterministic model is an approximation of the stochastic model and should capture, in most cases, the same dynamics.</p>
<p>So the objective of the last part of this session is to fit the deterministic SEITL and SEIT2L models to the Tristan da Cunha outbreak. This will prepare the next session and enable us to compare both models and assess whether one is significantly better than the other.</p>
<p>To save time, half of the group will fit the deterministic SEITL model and the other half will fit the deterministic SEIT2L model. In the rest of the session, most of the example will refer to the SEITL model, the same commands work for the SEIT2L model (i.e. <code>example(SEIT2L_deterministic)</code> instead of <code>example(SEITL_deterministic)</code>).</p>
<h2 id="run-a-mcmc">Run a MCMC</h2>
<p>Here you could use the function <code>my_mcmcMH</code> that you have already coded but it might result in poor acceptance rates since the models have 6 parameters to be estimated. Accordingly, using the adaptive MCMC might be a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>Take 5 min</strong> to have a look at the adaptive MCMC implemented in the function <code>mcmcMH</code>. As you can see, this function takes similar arguments as your function <code>my_mcmcMH</code> (<code>target</code>, <code>init.theta</code>, <code>proposal.sd</code> and <code>n.iterations</code>) plus several new ones that control the adaptive part of the algorithm and that you can learn about via the help page of <code>mcmcMH</code>. Note also that this function returns a list that contains, in addition to the trace, the acceptance rate and the empirical covariance matrix of the posterior. The latter will be useful to improve the covariance matrix of the Gaussian proposal when we will fit the stochastic model in the next session.</p>
<p>The next step is to write a wrapper function to evaluate the posterior at a given <code>theta</code> value. Here again, you could wrap the function <code>my_posterior</code> that you have already coded and pass it to <code>mcmcMH</code> so that it returns a sample of <code>theta</code> from the posterior distribution. However, as you will see at the end of this session, in order to be able to compare different models we also need to track the log-likelihood of the sampled <code>theta</code>s. Although this could be done by running <code>trajLogLike</code> on each returned <code>theta</code>, you might remember that the log-likelihood is actually computed in <code>my_posterior</code> so we could just use it. This is exactly what the function <code>logPosterior</code> does for you.</p>
<p><strong>Take 5 min</strong> to look at the code of <code>logPosterior</code>. As you can see, this function takes similar arguments as your function <code>my_posterior</code> (<code>fitmodel</code>, <code>theta</code>, <code>init.state</code> and <code>data</code>) plus one called <code>margLogLike</code>, which is a function to compute the log-likelihood of <code>theta</code>. By default, it is set to <code>trajLogLike</code> so you don't really need to bother with this argument (actually it will be useful in the next session as we will need a different function than <code>trajLogLike</code> to compute the log-likelihood). Note also that this function returns a list of two elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>log.density</code>: the log of the posterior density</li>
<li><code>trace</code>: a vector that contains, among other things, <code>theta</code> and its <code>log.likelihood</code>. All these information will be added to the <code>trace</code> data frame returned by <code>mcmcMH</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, <strong>take 15 min</strong> to prepare all the inputs to be able to run <code>mcmcMH</code> to fit your model. You should proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Which should print some informations as the chain runs: acceptance rate, state of the chain, log-likelihood etc. In particular, what can you say about the evolution of the acceptance rate?</p>
<p>Note that we have set-up the number of iterations to 5000. This is a benchmark and if your laptop is quite slow you might want to perform less iterations. Here the objective is to have a short - preliminary - run to calibrate your adaptive parameters before running a longer chain.</p>
<p><strong>Take 10 min</strong> to change the parameters controlling the adaptive part of the MCMC and look at the effect on the acceptance rate. Try to find a &quot;good&quot; combination of these parameters so that the acceptance rate is near the optimal value of 23% (actually, the algorithm efficiency remains high whenever the acceptance rate is between about 0.1 and 0.6 so any value in between is OK). If you can't find one, look at our <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#setting-the-mcmc">example</a>.</p>
<h2 id="short-run-analysis">Short run analysis</h2>
<p>Now it's time to use what you've learned in the previous session to analyse your MCMC outputs using the <code>coda</code> package. You didn't manage to run <code>mcmcMH</code>? Just use the results from our <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#run-a-mcmc">example</a>.</p>
<p>Note that because there are more than 6 parameters to look at, the <code>coda</code> functions used previously to plot the traces, densities and autocorrelations might not be optimal for laptop screens (the axis labels takes too much space). Fortunately, <code>coda</code> has another set of functions to make the plots more compacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>xyplot</code> for the trace.</li>
<li><code>densityplot</code> for the density.</li>
<li><code>acfplot</code> for the autocorrelation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a grouped documentation for these three functions by typing <code>?acfplot</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Take 10 min</strong> to analyse the trace returned by <code>mcmcMH</code>. Remember that, with the notation above, the trace can be accessed by <code>my_mcmc.TdC$trace</code> and then converted to a <code>mcmc</code> object so that the <code>coda</code> functions recognize it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># convert to a mcmc object for coda</span>
my_trace &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mcmc</span>(my_mcmc.TdC$trace)
<span class="co"># plot the trace</span>
<span class="kw">xyplot</span>(my_trace)</code></pre>
<p>Are you surprised by the trace of the log-prior? Determine what burning and thinning would be appropriate for your trace. Try to compare the thinned and unthinned traces (e.g. posterior estimates, density). Do you think it is important to thin?</p>
<p>If you are not sure about how to analyse your trace, have a look at our <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#short-run-analysis">example</a>.</p>
<h2 id="long-run-analysis">Long run analysis</h2>
<p>You should have noticed that the effective sample size (ESS) is quite small (&lt;100) for your preliminary run. By contrast, the ESS was much higher for the SIR model of the previous session with a similar number of iterations. However, this model has only 2 parameters against 6 for the SEITL and SEIT2L models. Intuitively, the more parameters you have the bigger is the parameter space and the longer it takes to the MCMC algorithm to explore it (<strong>some theoretical results?</strong>). This is why we need to run a much longer chain to achieve a descent ESS (~1000).</p>
<p>To save time, we have run 2 chains of 100 000 iterations starting from different initial <code>theta</code> values:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">theta1 =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dt">R0 =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">D.lat =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">D.inf =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">alpha =</span> <span class="fl">0.8</span>, <span class="dt">D.imm =</span> <span class="dv">16</span>, <span class="dt">rho =</span> <span class="fl">0.85</span>)

<p><strong>Take 15 min</strong> to analyse both chains together.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: the function <code>mcmc.list</code> of <code>coda</code> can be used to combine several <code>mcmc</code> objects into a <code>mcmc.list</code> object. Diagnostic functions which act on <code>mcmc</code> objects may also be applied to <code>mcmc.list</code> objects. In general, the chains will be combined, if this makes sense, otherwise the diagnostic function will be applied separately to each chain in the list.</p>
<p>Did the chains converged to the same distribution? What advantage can you see in combining several independent chains? Record the mean, median and 95% credible intervals of each parameter.</p>
<p>Finally, you should also assess the fit of your model by using the function <code>plotPosteriorFit</code>. This function takes a sample of <code>theta</code> from the trace, simulate some observations and plot them against the data, thus allowing you to assess the fit. <strong>Take 10 min</strong> to look at the documentation of this function and assess your fit, in particular try the different options for the argument <code>posterior.summary</code>.</p>
<p>Once again, if you are not sure how to complete these steps, have a look at our <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#long-run-analysis">example</a>.</p>
<h2 id="correlations">Correlations</h2>
<p>You can look at the correlations between your parameters using the function <code>levelplot</code> from the <code>coda</code> package. Note however that this function doesn't accept <code>mcmc.list</code> objects.</p>
<p>What parameters are strongly correlated?</p>
<p>You should have observed that, in contrast to the other parameters, the basic reproduction number (<span class="math">\(R_0\)</span>) and the infectious period (<span class="math">\(D_{inf}\)</span>) have wide 95% credible intervals. Can you explain why?</p>
<p>As previously stated, both the latent and infectious period have been estimated around 2 days in empirical studies and are unlikely to last more than 5 days. Are your estimates in agreement with these previous studies? If not, did your approach took into account these prior informations when fitting your model?</p>
<p>If not, modify <code>SEITL_deter</code> accordingly and re-run a short MCMC for 5000 iterations. Can you notice a difference in the posterior?</p>
<p>A solution can be found <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#correlations">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="informative-priors">Informative priors</h2>
<p>In order to take into account the results of previous empirical studies, we have re-run both chains for <span class="math">\(10^5\)</span> iterations with the following informative priors:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(D_{lat}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu=2,\sigma=1)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(D_{inf}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu=2,\sigma=1)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The corresponding outputs of <code>mcmcMH</code> were loaded with <code>data(mcmc_TdC_deter_longRun)</code> and should already be in your <strong>R</strong> environment:</p>

<p><strong>Take 15 min</strong> to perform the same analysis as before and compare the posteriors with and without informative priors. Which parameters have significantly different posteriors? Does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>A solution can be found <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#informative-priors">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="model-comparison">Model comparison</h2>
<p>We can compare the SEITL and SEIT2L models using the deviance information criterion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_information_criterion">DIC</a>).</p>
<p>The deviance of a parameter set <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is defined as <span class="math">\[
D(\theta)=-2\log(p(y|\theta)) + C
\]</span> where <span class="math">\(p(y|\theta)\)</span> is the likelihood of the data given <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is a constant that will cancel out when comparing two models.</p>
<p>The DIC can be computed as <span class="math">\[
\mathrm{DIC}=D(\bar\theta) + 2p_D
\]</span> where <span class="math">\(\bar\theta\)</span> is the mean of <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> with respect to the posterior distribution, and <span class="math">\(p_D\)</span> is the effective number of parameters, which is approximately equal to: <span class="math">\[p_D=\frac{1}{2}\hat{\mathrm{var}}(D(\theta))\]</span> that is half of the variance of the deviance with respect to the posterior distribution.</p>
<p>The idea is that models with smaller DIC should be preferred to models with larger DIC. Models are penalized both by the value of <span class="math">\(D(\bar\theta)\)</span>, which favors a good fit, but also by the effective number of parameters <span class="math">\(p_D\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(D(\bar\theta)\)</span> will decrease as the number of parameters in a model increases, the <span class="math">\(p_D\)</span> term compensates for this effect by favouring models with a smaller number of effective parameters.</p>
<p>Compute the DIC for your model. A solution is provided <a href="example_mcmc_seitl.html#model-selection">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to compare the DIC of the SEITL and SEIT2L model. Which model should be preferred? Is the difference substantial? You can have a look at the <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-dic/">MRC FAQ</a> on DIC to decide which model is the best.</p>
<h2 id="posterior-predictive-checks">Posterior predictive checks</h2>
<p>The DIC can only tells you which one of two or more models fit the data best; it doesn't give you any information on whether the model provides a good fit to the data /overall/.</p>
<p>On way to assess the overall quality of a fit is given by <em>posterior predictive checks</em>. It works by choosing a test statistic of the data (i.e., the peak, final size, etc.) and running many model replicates from parameter values that have been sampled from the posterior. One then tests how often in the simulations the test statistic takes a value as extreme or more extreme than the value it takes in the data. This allows to compute a p-value (a frequentist quantity, strictly speaking). If the data come out as an extreme case of model output (that is, the chosen test statistic or a more extreme value only comes up very rarely in the simulations), it would indicate that the model is not a good fit to the data.</p>
<p>Let's look at the maximum in the data</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">max</span>(FluTdC1971$obs)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 47</code></pre>
<p>Now, write a function that takes as argument a data frame of parameter samples, the number of trajectories to evaluate, the model, initial conditions and a data set, and which returns the Bayesian p-value of the test statistic in the data with respect to the posterior samples.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># This is a function that takes 4 arguments:</span>
<span class="co"># - trace, a data frame containing samples from the posterior</span>
<span class="co">#   distribution, one column per parameter </span>

    <span class="co"># return two-sided p-value</span>
